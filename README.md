A [Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/AH0KW28C9-brutalismbot) that mirrors posts from
[/r/brutalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/brutalism/new)
to a #channel of your choosing using
[incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).

## How It Works

After granting Brutalismbot permission to post to a #channel on your Slack workspace, Brutalismbot will save a copy of the incoming webhook URL to which it will publish posts.

Every hour Brutalismbot requests posts from reddit's REST API at [`/r/brutalism/new.json`](https://reddit.com/r/brutalism/new).

New image posts that haven't been seen before are saved, transformed into Slack messages using [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit), and published to your #channel via the incoming webhook URL.
